/*
* PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
* 
* To make it easy to update your theme, you should not edit the styles in this file. Instead use 
* the custom.css file that is located in your themes /css/ folder to add your styles. 
* You can copy a style rule from any of your css files and paste it in custom.css and
* it will override the original style. If you just want to add small css snippets you might also
* want to consider to add it to the designated CSS option field in your themes backend at: Theme Options->Styling
