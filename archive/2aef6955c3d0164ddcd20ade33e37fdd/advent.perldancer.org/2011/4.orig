<p>Most developers will have to handle authentication at some point, and
this usually means storing a password. Everyone knows that storing
plain-text passwords is a Bad Idea, but this raises
the question; how can I store the password safely?</p>
<p>If you store passwords as plain-text, stop it! Right now. There is no
good reason to store passwords as plain text, and it should never be
done. Database security <i>will</i> be breached, no matter how secure you make
your system. When that happens, an attacker has the login details for
every user in your system. Knowing that people often use the same
passwords for multiple systems, that plain-text password could open up
your users to attacks on their social networks, email, or even bank
accounts. This will land you as the system administrator in legal
trouble, as most countries have very strict laws governing the storage
of personal data.</p>
<h1><a name="password_storage_basic_principles"></a>Password storage basic principles</h1>

<p>The first step to safely storing a password is to not store the
password at all. You should be storing a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash</a>
of the password. A cryptographic hash is a one-way function; it is easy to
create one for a password, but almost impossible to get the original
password out.</p>
<p>To authenticate against a stored hash, you take the plain-text password
provided by your user, concatenate it with the salt for that user,
generate a hash using the same algorithm as your stored hash, and if
the newly generated hash matches the stored version, the password is
valid. The concept of salt is discussed later in this article.</p>
<p>There are password-less authentication schemes like OAuth that
don&rsquo;t require you to store or transmit the password or a hash of
it. But that is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<h1><a name="features_of_a_safely_stored_password"></a>Features of a safely stored password</h1>

<h2><a name="1_password_is_hashed_using_a_secure_one_way_hash"></a>1 Password is hashed using a secure one-way hash</h2>

<p>There are many cryptographic hash functions, and the next step is
deciding which one to use. Historically MD5 was the algorithm of
choice, but some clever maths geezers figured out how to reverse MD5
very quickly and it should not be used now. SHA&ndash;1 is another
popular choice, though it too is close to being broken in the same way
as MD5.</p>
<p>Next we have the SHA2 family of algorithms, SHA&ndash;256, and
SHA&ndash;512 being the most popular variants. These are fine choices
and are widely supported. They are not close to being broken, and
provide an adequate level of security against most categories of
attack.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the Bcrypt (BlowfishCrypt) algorithm is at least as
secure as the SHA2 family, but has one advantage - it is resistant to
brute force attacks as it includes an extra &ldquo;cost&rdquo; that
determines how computationally expensive it is to calculate the hash.
It gets around the brute force problem by being purposefully slow to
compute.</p>
<p>There are other algorithms, and the SHA3 competition is underway.
However these are the most commonly used, and are what this article
focuses on.</p>
<h2><a name="2_hashing_algorithm_should_be_resistant_to_brute_force_attack"></a>2 Hashing algorithm should be resistant to brute-force attack</h2>

<p>All these hash algorithms have one flaw in common. They are designed to
be quick, and are thus vulnerable to brute forcing.</p>
<p>On standard desktop hardware with off-the-shelf software you can
generate 2,300,000,000 SHA&ndash;1 hashes every second. That&rsquo;s
not a typo, 2.3 billion hashes a second. Even using pure perl tools and
using non-optimized code I can generate 1.3 million hashes a second on
my year-old laptop.</p>
<p>2.3 billion hashes a second means every single possible combination of
alphanumeric passwords less than 8 characters can be brute forced in 23
minutes. If your password is less than 8 characters and is stored as a
salted SHA&ndash;1 hash (A common scenario) - it is effectively plain
text.</p>
<p>Bcrypt can mitigate this class of attack by setting the cost to a high
value. A higher cost forces the algorithm to generate hashes at a
slower rate, making brute force attacks take an unfeasibly long amount
of time again.</p>
<h2><a name="3_password_hash_has_a_unique__cryptographically_random_salt"></a>3 Password hash has a unique, cryptographically random salt</h2>

<p>In addition to storing the hash of the password rather than the
plain-text, you must add a salt to it. The purpose of a salt is to make
sure that the same password does not always generate the same hash. A
salt is a bunch of random characters that are concatenated with the
password before hashing. You must use a different salt for every
password hash you generate for it to be effective.</p>
<p>There is widespread misunderstanding about what a salt is supposed to
do. Some people treat a salt like a secret key, specific to their
application and use the same salt with every password - meaning the
original point of a salt, to stop the same passwords hashing to the
same value - is lost.</p>
<p>Salt isn&rsquo;t any more secret than the password hash itself and
should be stored along with the password hash. It isn&rsquo;t a secret
key, and doesn&rsquo;t help preventing brute force attacks. If someone
has access to your database and the password hashes, they have access
to your salt too. Don&rsquo;t treat salt like a secret key.</p>
<p>An ideal salt should be cryptographically random, so the chance that
two hashes having the same salt is minimal.</p>
<h1><a name="recommended_best_practice"></a>Recommended Best Practice?</h1>

<p>The bcrypt algorithm is recommended for all new development work. Its
resistance to brute force attacks is a key factor, and is only going to
increase it&rsquo;s appeal as computers get ever faster and start
generating trillions of hashes per second.</p>
<p>If your legacy code is using SHA&ndash;256 or SHA&ndash;512, AND uses
a random salt for every password - you should be fine for the time
being. Brute forcing a SHA&ndash;512 hash still takes a length of time
that borders of practicality.</p>
<p>If you use SHA&ndash;1, MD5, or store passwords as plain-text - you
need to change your policy right away. Your passwords are insecure, and
at serious risk when your database is breached.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a random salt for each user, you should start
doing so right away. Modules like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::Entropy">Data::Entropy</a> provide easy
ways to get good random-ness.</p>
<h1><a name="common_questions"></a>Common Questions</h1>

<h2><a name="1_no_one_will_breach_my_security_and_access_my_database"></a>1 No one will breach my security and access my database</h2>

<p>That is a bad attitude to have. Recent news shows database compromises
on the most secure systems, staffed by experts with lots of money.</p>

<p>Do you really believe that your system is inherently more secure than
theirs?</p>
<h2><a name="2_why_not_my_own_custom__secret_algorithm"></a>2 Why not my own custom, secret algorithm?</h2>

<p>Just because you can&rsquo;t find a shortcut to your algorithm, it
doesn&rsquo;t mean that there isn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>The hashing algorithms above have had some of the greatest mathematical
minds of the 20th century working on them for the past 40 years, and
they still made mistakes - leaving MD5 and SHA&ndash;1 vulnerable.</p>
<p>Hubris is a characteristic of a great programmer, but it is highly
unlikely that you are better at crypto-algorithms than the people who
created these general purpose hashing algorithms</p>
<h2><a name="3_what_modules_should_i_use_to_hash_my_passwords"></a>3 What modules should I use to hash my passwords?</h2>

<p>As with everything in perl, There Is More Than One Way To Do It.</p>
<p>If you want to do everything manually, you can use the venerable <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Digest">Digest</a> set
of modules, or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt">Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt</a> if you are using
bcrypt.</p>
<p>If you want a nicer interface that manages the dangerous bits for you,
the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Authen::Passphrase">Authen::Passphrase</a> set of modules is a good choice.</p>
<p>If you are using Dancer, you can use my own
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dancer::Plugin::Passphrase">Dancer::Plugin::Passphrase</a> module. It has an interface
similar to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Authen::Passphrase">Authen::Passphrase</a>, and manages all the common
hashing algorithms</p>
<h1><a name="dancer__plugin__passphrase"></a>Dancer::Plugin::Passphrase</h1>

<p>The plugin exports the passphrase keyword, to which you pass a
plaintext password. From this you can generate a hash using whatever
algorithm you specify. It defaults to bcrypt with a work factor of 4.</p>
<p>You can match a plaintext password to a stored hash by using the
matches method.</p>
<p>An example Dancer app is below. See the documentation of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dancer::Plugin::Passphrase">Dancer::Plugin::Passphrase</a> for further details</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">package MyWebService;
use Dancer ':syntax';
use Dancer::Plugin::Passphrase;
 
post '/save_password' sub =&gt; {
    my $hash = passphrase( param('password') )-&gt;generate_hash;
 
    # [...] Store $hash in DB
};
 
get '/check_password' sub =&gt; {
    # [...] Retrieve $stored_hash from the DB
 
    if ( passphrase( param('password') )-&gt;matches( $stored_hash ) ) {
        # Password matches!
    }
};</pre>
