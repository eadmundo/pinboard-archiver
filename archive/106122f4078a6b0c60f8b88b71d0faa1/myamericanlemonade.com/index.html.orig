		<p>Poorer than most, I remember my grandmother and aunts comparing our situation to the Bulgarian equivalent to <em>the Joneses</em>. It must have hurt them to know that my father was a university professor, but the whole family was poor nonetheless. As a kid I often wanted him to sacrifice his beliefs for the good of the family. As an adult, I am more compassionate and on a good day, applaud him. Mom worked as a lab assistant at the technical institute and only joined the party because of her memories. Born into a family of “bourgeois sympathizers”, her family was under threat daily because they wouldn’t get behind the regime. I am beginning to think that some of her fears might have been unfounded or irrational, but they were there and quite real to us. Whatever the cause of these fears, Mom decided to join the party as a way to appease the powers that be. But everybody saw right through it.</p>
<p>So, too broke to afford more, my parents made the decision to separate the three of us. From infancy until I was seven, I lived with my maternal grandmother and two aunts. We occupied a single room in a community building, where we shared a kitchen and an outhouse with the rest of the tenants. Until I visited my friend, I thought this was normal. When I realized that I lived very differently from other kids, I remember how the desire for my own space and a “normal life” became overwhelming. Why was I only seeing my parents on the weekends, while my sister, born a year after me, stayed with them? I felt like an outsider and more comfortable with my grandmother, Mama Mia, and aunts Anna and Beba.</p>
<p>By age seven I moved back with my parents and sister. I was supposedly home, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was leaving my real family to go live with distant relatives. I often wonder how Mom and Dad got through most days. My sister and I argued a lot and as a family, we didn’t spend much time together, other than the evening meal. I dreaded dinner time. My parents fought a lot, or we were all silent as we sat around the table with the bland and unappealing food Mom threw together.</p>

		<p><em>Bulgaria, 1970s.</em></p>
<p>Usually very private, it would take a few drinks for my Uncle Stefan to tell us stories about America. Around the dinner table one night, I remember him recounting his trip to visit an old college friend who’d defected. “In America,” he said as he leaned back in his chair and seemed to savor the words, “police can’t stop you on the street and ask for an ID.” This was mind-blowing to us, considering that such practice was commonplace in Bulgaria. America meant wide open spaces, abundance in every way you can imagine, and friendly people who weren’t burdened by oppression. I learned from him about degrees of freedom unheard of in our home country. My uncle worshipped America and now I did too. I dreamed of America daily after that.</p>
<p>It was the circumstances of my early years that laid the foundation for this yearning. Learning that America promised freedom of speech, financial opportunity, and space to breathe−exactly what we were lacking − fueled the intensity of my longing. <em>Have-nots</em> were the rule for most in Bulgaria, though my father made our situation worse. I both blamed and understood him for some of what we didn’t have. A university professor, he staunchly refused to join the Communist party, ensuring that he’d never get the financial and social benefits that other professors at the university received for their allegiance. His colleagues of similar rank were getting higher salaries, plus additional income-generating opportunities, such as lectures, publications, etc. Dad was shut out of everything. As a young boy who’d listened to my Uncle Stefan’s stories, the unfairness of it was even clearer to me. In America he wouldn’t be punished for his beliefs and opinions.</p>

		<p><em>(continued from &#8220;<a href="http://myamericanlemonade.com/2012/11/08/a-hard-knock/" target="_blank">A hard knock</a>&#8220;)</em></p>
<p>“Put on some sneakers, we’ll take you to the office,” he answered, ignoring my questions.</p>
<p>“For how long?” Didn’t I at least have the right to know this?</p>
<p>“A couple of hours, maybe a couple of days.” His words as vague as all his other answers.</p>
<p>Finally I nod and turn to go get ready, my hands curled into fists at my side. Baldy comes in to wait for me, the other two stay outside.</p>
<p>I think then about a very successful meeting I’d had the day before. It was a huge contract for me and I’d planned to work on it today. The project? Consulting for a government entity. I couldn’t help but see the irony. I’m both mad and anxious that it’ll have to wait. Same goes for the sailing I’d planned to do tonight.</p>
<p>At the doorway of my son’s room, I stop a moment to watch him while he sleeps. Finally I go and touch his shoulder, tell him ICE is here. “Dress up and let’s go to their office,” I say. He looks confused but seems to know better than to ask a lot of questions.</p>
<p>My hands shake as I put on my sneakers. Baldy is impatient as he hovers too close and I want to tell him to back-off.</p>
<p>As I lock the front door, a fourth guy comes from around the back. Was he stationed there just in case? I want to ask, “Do I look like the type of guy who’s going to take off?”, but don’t–instead, I quietly feel the indignity to my core. After all, I work here, raised my family here, pay my fair share of taxes. It’s the only country my son knows, English the only language he speaks. I feel as American as any U.S. citizen, with the same allegiances. But they don’t care. They don’t care that I’m a Fulbright Scholar and have received many awards, including the honor of Outstanding Professor. They don’t care that the office of George H.W. Bush awarded me a certificate for my work.</p>
<p>Guy #4 leads us to a nondescript SUV. In an almost apologetic tone, he tells my son and me that we have to ride in the back. He says he is supposed to handcuff us, but won’t–not until we get to our destination.</p>
<p>Handcuffs? Are we being arrested? At no time has someone said the words, “You are under arrest”, like I’ve seen in the movies. But last time I checked, handcuffs aren’t used for those free to go about their day.</p>
<p>We drive from North Brunswick to Newark, NJ. It’s surreal. My son is giving the driver directions while he is texting. I warn him he should put the phone away, but he dismisses me. I feel pride at his brazenness, but at the same time it scares me it will make things worse for us.</p>
<p>Gradually it begins to dawn on me that this is the culmination of my 20-year U.S. immigration saga. 20 years of hopes and dreams that tomorrow will be better than today, crushed. It is darkest when hope is gone.</p>

		<p><em>New Jersey, October 2011</em></p>
<p>A hard knock on my front door breaks the quiet ease of my morning. Maybe a deliveryman, except they usually ring the bell. Plus, I wasn’t expecting any packages, but perhaps my wife is. I’d ask her if she hadn’t already left for work. For a moment I wonder if I should answer. A voice in my head says no, but I ignore it.</p>
<p>Two guys in their mid-thirties are there, dressed in regular clothes. Experience tells me this can’t be good.</p>
<p>“Hi,” one of them says. “We are conducting an investigation. We are from Homeland Security. ICE. Who lives here?”</p>
<p>Damn. “I live here,” I answer, and make a mental note to start listening to my gut.</p>
<p>Because of our immigration status, we’d had a lot of interaction with the authorities over the years. They knew where we lived. We’d shown up for every court date, every appointment, everything. I tell myself there should be no reason to be concerned.</p>
<p>Pushing away the urge to ask them to go away, I invite them in. They don’t budge. Instead, one guy pulls out a yellow folder with a half-inch-thick stack of paper inside and opens it. A picture of my son stares up at me. I now know for sure this is not like my other encounters with H.S. I feel protective, almost territorial. This is my son, after all. I want to rip the picture from the folder.</p>
<p>“Does Enislav live here?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he is my son.” My heart starts beating too fast now. Anger triggers a rush of adrenaline; the violation into my private life leaves me sick inside.</p>
<p>“Is he here?”</p>
<p>I want to say no. I want to telepathically send a message to Eni to climb out his bedroom window and go to his sister’s house.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I answer through a clenched jaw.</p>
<p>“Who else lives here?”</p>
<p>“My wife.”</p>
<p>“Is she here?”</p>
<p>“No, she left for work.” I say silent thanks that she’d already left for the day, but at the same time need her.</p>
<p>“Listen, we have a warrant for you. We need to satisfy the warrant.” No emotion. They are well-trained.</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” I ask, trying to outwardly maintain a steadiness I’m not feeling.</p>
<p>“You have to come with us to the office to fill out some paperwork.”</p>
<p>A third guy with a shaved head suddenly comes around and wants to know if everything is okay. Everything is okay, his buddies tell him. I feel outnumbered and realize that was their intent.</p>
<p>“So why don’t you go get your son and get ready,” one finally says.</p>
<p>“Get ready for what?” My voice is shaking a bit, betraying me with its lack of confidence. “Listen, I have never been through something like this. What am I getting ready for?” I nearly yell those last words, but stop short. Growing up during the Cold War in a Communist country, I’m well aware of what yelling at authority will get you. In Bulgaria this happened. But in the U.S? Incomprehensible.</p>

		<p>My wife was already at work when ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) showed up at our door. It was nine a.m., October 5, 2011, a day that began like every other in our New Jersey home. My son Enislav still slept, I drank my last bit of coffee while arranging the day in my head. I’d planned to spend several hours on a contract for a government agency and hopefully sailing later. There was no reason to think my family’s American lives would radically change in the next few hours. But by noon, it was clear. After a car ride in the back of a federal SUV, Eni and I wore orange jumpsuits at Delaney Hall, our home for the next 65 days. No college classes for Eni that day or many future ones. My consulting firm would have no leader. My wife and daughter were left afraid for our safety and future.</p>
<p>Day after day from my bunk, I listened to the immigration stories of my roommates. We all had one. Mine involved over 20 years of countless dollars spent on lawyers who would help me navigate the paperwork and court dates necessary for immigration, based on my request for political asylum. Meanwhile I strived to be tops in my field, starting with a presidential certificate from George H. W. Bush and receiving an Outstanding Professor designation from INS, ICE’s predecessor agency. I started my own company, paid taxes, and raised two children here. But that obviously wasn’t enough. I had failed at giving me and my family what we wanted most: U.S. citizenship. I dug deep, used what my family had taught me about resolve and hope, and thought a lot about my past to remind myself why I’d left Bulgaria. Why I’d bothered. The irony was especially palpable to me lying in that bunk, recalling the moment I knew for sure I must leave.</p>
<p>It was on the eve of my wedding to Mayia in 1983. We were excited, planning our future careers as architects as we walked arm and arm down Rakovski Street in Sofia. Before we reached our local hangout, a favorite for their never-ending supply of Coca Cola, I saw some of my friends running in the opposite direction and yelling for us to do the same. Instead, we kept walking. I had the required identification and so did Mayia, so we needn’t worry. We were wrong. Two militiamen grabbed me and left her there, forcing me on a bus with other men they’d picked up. It was that moment when my decision to leave was solidified. I must leave this police state as soon as possible. I must live in the land of the free, where such a thing could never happen. Where they don’t detain innocent people.</p>
<p>But I was wrong. How else do you explain why in 2011 I was detained in a bunk, my son in the one above me, in the United States of America?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I arrived in the US in 1991 at the age of 33. Like millions before me, I decided to seek a better life for me and my family in The Land Of Opportunity. I thought good citizenship, academic excellence, and successful entrepreneurship would easily pave the way. I was wrong.</p>
<p>After eighteen years of legal wrangling with the US immigration authorities, my son and I were detained in a for-profit facility in Newark, New Jersey, and threatened with deportation. We were released after 65 days in detention, following a massive campaign of public support. Our case is still pending.</p>
<p>On this blog I will be publishing excerpts from my forthcoming book about my family’s ordeal. This is My American Lemonade.</p>
